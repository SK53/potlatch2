Double-click to finish the line or press Enter.</p>\n            <p><b>To create a polygon</b>, begin by clicking on the map at its start point, then click at each successive point (similar to creating a way), and finish by clicking on the very first point to close the polygon.</p>\n            <p>Remember, if you make a mistake, you can always hit the Undo button.
